## My Process  

### Built With  

- **Semantic HTML5** markup  
- **CSS3** custom properties  
- **Flexbox** for layout  
- **Mobile-first workflow**  

### What I Learned  

During this challenge, I improved my understanding of **CSS Flexbox** and how to style a **responsive card component**. Some key learnings include:  

- Using `display: flex;` for centering the container  
- Applying `border-radius` for smooth rounded corners  
- Adding `box-shadow` for a clean and modern look  

Here’s a small code snippet of my container styling:  

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  text-align: center;
  max-width: 300px;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  border-radius: 15px;
  padding: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```  

### Continued Development  

Moving forward, I want to:  

- Improve my **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** skills  
- Work on **more responsive designs** for different screen sizes  
- Learn **SCSS** for better styling management
